//appraoch - here you need to find a tower which is far from the land so iam using queue(bfs) here at one step iam converting all the four directions of all the land into land and pushing those coordiantes into queue if they are tower and converting them into land  we do this until queue is empty.  
/*

You are a telecom engineer working in airtel, you are receiving complaints about weak signal, now you want to make analysis on this. Then you made a n x n grid of all cell phone towers, where each grid consists of 0(presence of a tower) and 1( plane land -absence of a tower).Find a tower cell such that its distance to the nearest 1 cell is maximized, and return the distance. If no tower or plane exists in the grid, return -1.

the distance between two cells (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is |x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|.

 Example 1:
Input=3
1 0 1
0 0 0
1 0 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The cell (1, 1) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 2.

Example 2:
Input=3
1 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
Output: 4
Explanation: The cell (2, 2) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 4.

Constraints:
n == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= n <= 100
grid[i][j] is 0 or 1
